# News-Web-Scraping

### *There are two web scraping projects included:*

The first project uses the Beautiful Soup library to scrape Hacker News link, title and votes rank from the most click to the least and crawl the number of pages based on user input. It helps us to find the more popular news in no time.

The second project uses Selenium with Python to automate the process. We can type in the search keywords, choose the number of pages to crawl, then generate the Reuters News title, contents, and timestamp.
